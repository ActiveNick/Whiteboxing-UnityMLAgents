# Whiteboxing-UnityMLAgents
Experimental testbed where I test various Machine Learning &amp; AI concepts using Unity ML Agents.

**Unity version:** 2018.1.0b13 (beta)
**Unity ML-Agents version:** 0.3.0b

## Project Setup
* The [TensorflowSharp](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Background-TensorFlow.md#tensorflowsharp) plugins folder was omitted from this project due to the massive file sizes. You will need to import this set of Unity plugins yourself. You can download the TensorFlowSharp plugin as a [Unity package here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/unity-ml-agents/0.3/TFSharpPlugin.unitypackage).
